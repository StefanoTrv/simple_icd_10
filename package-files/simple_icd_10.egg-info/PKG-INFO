* **1.5.0**: Added the function "is_leaf", renamed the function "is_valid_code" to "is_category_or_subcategory" (the old name can still be used for backward compatibility), removed from the README a section rendered obsolete by this renaming.
* **1.4.0**: Added the functions "is_chapter", "is_block", "is_category" and "is_subcategory"
* **1.3.2**: Re-relase of the previous version (pretend this doesn't exist)
* **1.3.1**: Huge performance improvements, bug fix
* **1.3.0**: Additional major performance improvements
* **1.2.1**: Minor fix to ensure the integrity of the data

## Introduction
The scope of this library is to provide a simple instrument for dealing with ICD-10 codes in your Python projects. It provides ways to check whether a code exists, to find its ancestors and descendants, to see its description and much more.  
The codes and their descriptions were taken from [this page](https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en#) in the WHO's website and are referred to the **2019 version of ICD-10**.  
If you are looking for a library that deals with ICD-10-CM codes instead of ICD-10 codes, you can check the [simple_icd_10_CM library](https://github.com/StefanoTrv/simple_icd_10_CM).

You can find the all the codes and their descriptions in plain text in the "data" folder.

## Setup
You can either use the "simple_icd_10.py" file that contains all the source code (you can find it in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/StefanoTrv/simple_icd_10)), or install the package with pip, using this command:
```bash
pip install simple-icd-10
```

If you prefer conda, you can install the package using the following command:
```bash
conda install -c stefanotrv simple_icd_10 
```

## What a code is and how it looks like
We need to start by clarifying what a code is for us. The [ICD-10 instruction manual](https://icd.who.int/browse10/Content/statichtml/ICD10Volume2_en_2019.pdf) makes a distinction between **chapters**, **block of categories**, **three-character categories** and **four-character subcategories** (which from now on we'll refer to as chapters, blocks, categories and subcategories), with a few additional five-character subcategories: we will consider all these items as codes.

Generally speaking, the codes of subcategories can be written in two different ways: with a dot (for example "I13.1") and without the dot (for example "I131"). The functions in this library can receive as input codes in both these formats. The codes returned by the functions will always be in the format without the dot. You can easily change the format of a code by using the [`remove_dot`](#remove_dotcode) and [`add_dot`](#add_dotcode) functions.

## Memoization
Since version 1.2.0, this library uses [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) to improve the speed of several functions. While I suggest you always keep it enabled because of the great performance improvements that it brings, you are provided with functions to disable and re-enable it as you wish.

## Documentation
Here I will list all the functions provided by this library and describe how to use them. If you are interested in a more interactive introduction to simple_icd_10, please take a look at the Jupyter Notebook ["Showcase notebook.ipynb"](https://github.com/StefanoTrv/simple_icd_10/blob/master/Showcase%20notebook.ipynb); there you can also find more examples.

Here we suppose we have imported the library as follows:
```python
import simple_icd_10 as icd
```
### is_valid_item(code)
This function takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a valid chapter, block, category or subcategory in ICD-10, False otherwise.
```python
icd.is_valid_item("cat")
#False
icd.is_valid_item("B99")
#True
```
### is_category_or_subcategory(code)
This function takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a valid category or subcategory in ICD-10, False otherwise.
```python
icd.is_category_or_subcategory("A00-B99")
#False
icd.is_category_or_subcategory("B99")
#True
```
### is_chapter_or_block(code)
This function takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a valid chapter or block in ICD-10, False otherwise.
```python
icd.is_chapter_or_block("A00-B99")
#True
icd.is_chapter_or_block("B99")
#False
```
### is_chapter(code)
This function takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a valid chapter in ICD-10, False otherwise.
```python
icd.is_chapter("XII")
#True
icd.is_chapter("B99")
#False
```
### is_block(code)
This function takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a valid block in ICD-10, False otherwise.
```python
icd.is_block("A00-B99")
#True
icd.is_block("B99")
#False
```
### is_category(code)
This function takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a valid category in ICD-10, False otherwise.
```python
icd.is_category("B99")
#True
icd.is_category("XIV")
#False
```
### is_subcategory(code)
This function takes a string as input and returns True if the string is a valid subcategory in ICD-10, False otherwise.
```python
icd.is_subcategory("B95.1")
#True
icd.is_subcategory("B99")
#False
```
### get_description(code)
This function takes a string as input. If the string is a valid ICD-10 code, it returns a string with its short description, otherwise it raises a ValueError.
```python
icd.get_description("XII")
#"Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue"
icd.get_description("F00")
#"Dementia in Alzheimer disease"
```
### get_parent(code)
This function takes a string as input. If the string is a valid ICD-10 code, it returns a string containing its parent, otherwise it raises a ValueError. If the code doesn't have a parent (that is, if it's a chapter), it returns an empty string.
```python
icd.get_parent("C00")
#"C00-C14"
icd.get_parent("XII")
#""
```
### get_children(code)
This function takes a string as input. If the string is a valid ICD-10 code, it returns a list of strings containing its children, otherwise it raises a ValueError. If the code doesn't have children, it returns an empty list.
```python
icd.get_children("XII")
#['L00-L08', 'L10-L14', 'L20-L30', 'L40-L45', 'L50-L54', 'L55-L59', 'L60-L75', 'L80-L99']
icd.get_children("H60.1")
#[]
```
### get_ancestors(code)
This function takes a string as input. If the string is a valid ICD-10 code, it returns a list containing all its ancestors in the ICD-10 classification, otherwise it raises a ValueError. The results are ordered from its parent to its most distant ancestor.
```python
icd.get_ancestors("H60.1")
#['H60', 'H60-H62', 'VIII']
```
### get_descendants(code)
This function takes a string as input. If the string is a valid ICD-10 code, it returns a list containing all its descendants in the ICD-10 classification, otherwise it raises a ValueError. While usually the returned codes are ordered, no particular order is guaranteed.
```python
icd.get_descendants("C00")
#['C000', 'C001', 'C002', 'C003', 'C004', 'C005', 'C006', 'C008', 'C009']
```
### is_ancestor(a,b)
This function takes two strings as input. If both strings are valid ICD-10 codes, it returns True if the first string is an ancestor of the second string. If at least one of the strings is not a valid ICD-10 code, it raises a ValueError.
```python
icd.is_ancestor("XVIII","R01.0")
#True
icd.is_ancestor("K00-K14","M31")
#False
```
### is_descendant(a,b)
This function takes two strings as input. If both strings are valid ICD-10 codes, it returns True if the first string is a descendant of the second string. If at least one of the strings is not a valid ICD-10 code, it raises a ValueError.
```python
icd.is_descendant("R01.0","XVIII")
#True
icd.is_descendant("M31","K00-K14")
#False
```
### get_nearest_common_ancestor(a,b)
This function takes two strings as input. If both strings are valid ICD-10 codes, it returns the nearest common ancestor if it exists, an empty string if it doesn't exist. If at least one of the strings is not a valid ICD-10 code, it raises a ValueError.
```python
icd.get_nearest_common_ancestor("H28.0","H25.1")
#"H25-H28"
icd.get_nearest_common_ancestor("K35","E21.0")
#""
```
### is_leaf(code)
This function takes a string as input. If the string is a valid ICD-10 code, it returns True if the code is a leaf in the ICD-10 classification (that is, it has no descendants), False otherwise. If the string is not a valid ICD-10 code it raises a ValueError.
```python
icd.is_leaf("H28")
#False
icd.is_leaf("H28.0")
#True
#""
```
### get_all_codes(keep_dots)
This function takes a boolean for input and returns the list of all items in the ICD-10 classification. If the boolean is True the subcategories in the list will have a dot in them, if it's False the subcategories won't have a dot in them.
```python
icd.get_all_codes(True)
#['I', 'A00-A09', 'A00', 'A00.0', 'A00.1', 'A00.9', 'A01', 'A01.0', ...
icd.get_all_codes(False)
#['I', 'A00-A09', 'A00', 'A000', 'A001', 'A009', 'A01', 'A010', ...
```
### get_index(code)
This function takes a string as input. If the string is a valid ICD-10 code, it returns its index in the list returned by `get_all_codes`, otherwise it raises a ValueError.
```python
icd.get_index("P00")
#7159
icd.get_all_codes(True)[7159]
#"P00"
```
### remove_dot(code)
This function takes a string as input. If the string is a valid ICD-10 code, it returns the same code in the notation without the dot, otherwise it raises a ValueError.
```python
icd.remove_dot("H60.1")
#"H601"
icd.remove_dot("H601")
#"H601"
icd.remove_dot("G10-G14")
#"G10-G14"
```
### add_dot(code)
This function takes a string as input. If the string is a valid ICD-10 code, it returns the same code in the notation with the dot, otherwise it raises a ValueError.
```python
icd.add_dot("H60.1")
#"H60.1"
icd.add_dot("H601")
#"H60.1"
icd.add_dot("G10-G14")
#"G10-G14"
```
### disable_memoization()
This function disables memoization and deletes the results that memoization has saved so far. If memoization is already disabled, nothing happens.
```python
icd.disable_memoization()
```
### enable_memoization()
This function enables memoization. Memoization is enabled by default, so you only need this function if it was previously disabled. If memoization is already enabled, nothing happens.
```python
icd.enable_memoization()
```
### reset_memoization()
This function deletes the results that memoization has saved so far. This function is automatically called by `disable_memoization`.
```python
icd.reset_memoization()
```
